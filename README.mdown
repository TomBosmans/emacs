## My emacs setup

Got the great idea to start using Emacs, so this is my current setup that most likely will change alot in the coming years.
I use Cask so this only works for Emacs 24 and up

## How to install For macOS

- brew cask install emacs
- brew install cask
- put all this in you `~/.emacs.d` folder.
- cask install
